The two algorithms differ simply because one uses stacks and one uses queues. While they 
both pop on coordinates based on the position they're at, each algorithm investigates those 
points in a different order. Namely, the stack investigates the last coordinate that got 
popped on, while queues investigate the first. This means that stacks will go as far as 
possible down a certain path before investigating other possibilities, while a queue will 
investigate all the possibilities at a given coordinate before proceeding through a path.
